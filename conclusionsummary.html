      In conclusion, certain practices and culture seems rather unfair for people today and wouldn't work out the same way<br>
      it did back then. It gives us gender issues and the sense of injustice and discrimination in our society. Instead, let<br>
      us all work on gender equality.<br><br>

      To summarize everything, basically, gender roles has become a big part in the Aztec civilization's community and it<br>
      still is today. This stereotyped gender roles itself has caused sub problems such as discrimination and inequality.<br>
      People's duties were also determined through the gender roles that they possessed, and lessening opportunities for<br>
      people because they aren't "fit" for that duty. This has also resulted to sexism and gender expectations from people.
