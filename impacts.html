    The roles and duties for the people in the past were affected which resulted to certain differences among them.
<br><br>
    - Women were to raise the daughters and men were to raise the sons.
    <br><br>
    - Daughters become female priests or cihuatlmacazqui and accompany male tasks by spinning, weaving clothing,<br>
and cleaning the temple.
<br><br>
    - Men occupied roles that would allow them to accomplish tasks that would demonstrate their masculinity<br>
(such as succession in hunting) among the opposite gender.
<br><br>
    - When it comes to marriage, the newlywed will always move in the groom's family and the males could take<br>
as many secondary wives or concubines as they could sustain.
<br><br>
    And when it comes to authorities and such, the role of tribal leaders pertained to the men most of the time, yet, women<br>
    (that are particularly elder) took the religious leadership roles and even served in tribal meetings.
    <br><br>    
    This has also impacted our society today as stated before. Femininity and masculinity were socially constructed. This<br>
    results in further sexism that we know of today especially in the media as well as toxic masculinity and gender<br>
    expectations from people. The inequality of marriage also often results to toxic households and abuse. Though the good<br>
    news is that women now have more rights than before.
