        The following are the potential or suggested solutions for this problem:<br><br>

        1. One of the things we could do in order to break stereotyped gender roles is to equally give opportunities to both<br>
        men and women. This would mean that men could also do the jobs women do, and women can also do the jobs that men do.<br><br>
        
        2. Look for opportunities to raise awareness about stereotypes, whether they come from resources or from the person.<br><br>
        
        3. Do not set any gender expectations because this would only lead to more stereotypes. This would mean that we should<br>
        let the people be who they are and not tell them what they should or should not be.<br><br>
        
        4. Respect people and not judge. Even if we have different cultures/beliefs, one must not judge the other for the way<br>
        they act/are. This way, we can avoid further stereotyping.<br><br>
        
        5. Briefly educate people about it and how it affects people. The more people that know about it, the more they can<br>
        understand how it is wrong.<br><br>
